          "A Treaty is an agreement which was made in a sacred trust between the
          Indigenous Peoples of Canada and the Crown. First Nations Treaties are
          negotiated agreements that clearly spell out the rights,
          responsibilities and relationships of First Nations and the federal
          and provincial governments.‚Äù- Livelearn

        <h2>Why learn about treaties?</h2>
        <p class="info-blocks">
          "This means that Treaties do not involve only the First Nations and
          the government or the Crown, it also involves you. Every Canadian has
          Treaty rights. For example, if you own property or plan on owning
          property in Canada, you are exercising a right that goes back to the
          very first signed Treaties. Treaties benefit all Canadians. They
          ensure the well-being of both parties to the agreement through
          economic and political means."- Livelearn
